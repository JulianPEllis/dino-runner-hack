# Dino Runner Ultimate Hack
This hack will make it impossible for you to get a game over, and will clock deaths that should've happened, as well as keeping your high speed later in the game.

This hack works on both the offline page and https://chromedino.com

## How to reset
Same as how to use, paste the contents of `reset.js` into the console and press ENTER('RETURN')

## Utility Functions
`stats()` - Show statistic information including how many times the gameOver() function was called and how many times the speed has been reset.

`startCSLoop()` - Show statistic information as it's called, is console spam.

`stopCSLoop()` - Stop showing statistic information. Stop console spam.
